# Geofence
This software provides drones with Geo-fencing capabilities, (in addition to other things), and is designed to rely on the bare minimum of equipment onboard a drone, usually a GPS module is enough.

The software is initially and primirely designed for the Raspberry-Pi SBC, and the Arduino family of boards and mathching modules (for both the Pi and Arduino).

This software is not ready for use on real equipment yet, keep an eye on future updates.
