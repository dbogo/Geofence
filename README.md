# Geofence
This software provides drones with Geo-fencing capabilities, (in addition to other things), and is designed to rely on the bare minimum of equipment onboard a drone, usually a GPS module is enough.

The software is initially and primirely designed for the Raspberry-Pi SBC, and the Arduino family of boards and mathching modules (for both the Pi and Arduino).

The software is not ready for use on real equipment yet.
